# C-2UnityIPC

Trying to send data from C++ to Unity. More exactly, trying to send the number of objects that have to be spawned in Unity.

The project consists of an application developed in Unity that serves as a prototype for a robot with integrated cameras. Through a split-screen configuration, the application provides a view of the scene and a view of what the robot observes. Using socket communication with the C++ language, the application allows sending commands to Unity to generate objects at random positions. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the use of prototyping in the development of image processing robots and the generation of video data for datasets used in various applications, such as depth from focus, object labeling, etc.
